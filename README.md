- **Git**: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Linux

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libmpv-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake git pkgconfig mpv-libs-devel mesa-libGL-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git pkgconf mpv mesa
```

## Platform Support

- ✅ **macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)** - Fully tested and supported
- ⚠️ **Windows** - Should work, but untested in this fork
- ⚠️ **Linux** - Should work, but untested in this fork

For Windows and Linux, follow the build instructions below. They should work as the codebase is cross-platform, but please report any issues you encounter.

## Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ack00gar/OFS.git
cd OFS
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Build

#### macOS (Apple Silicon) - TESTED ✅

```bash
# Configure for ARM64 native build (Debug mode for full features)
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

# Build (use all CPU cores)
cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)

# The app bundle will be at: bin/OpenFunscripter.app
```

#### macOS (Universal Binary - Intel + ARM64)

```bash
# Configure for universal binary
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64" \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

# Build
cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

#### Windows - UNTESTED ⚠️

```bash
# Configure
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build build --config Debug -j%NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%

# The executable will be at: bin\OpenFunscripter.exe
```

**Note:** Windows build is untested in this fork. The build should work as the original OFS supports Windows, but please report any issues.

#### Linux - UNTESTED ⚠️

```bash
# Configure
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# The executable will be at: bin/OpenFunscripter
```

**Note:** Linux build is untested in this fork. The build should work as the original OFS supports Linux, but please report any issues.

### 3. Install (Optional)

#### macOS

```bash
# Copy to Applications folder
cp -R bin/OpenFunscripter.app /Applications/
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Copy to /usr/local/bin
sudo cp bin/OpenFunscripter /usr/local/bin/
```

## Build Types

Choose the appropriate build type based on your needs:

- **Debug** (Recommended for development)
  - Includes debug symbols and development features
  - "Reset layout" option in View menu
  - Larger file size (~24MB on macOS)
  - No optimizations (slower performance)
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

- **Release** (Production)
  - Fully optimized for performance
  - Smallest file size (~5.5MB on macOS)
  - No debug features
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

- **RelWithDebInfo** (Balanced)
  - Optimized with debug symbols
  - Medium file size (~6MB on macOS)
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

## SDL2 Compilation Fix (macOS ARM64)

This build includes a fix for SDL2 compilation on macOS ARM64. The fix prevents C99 declaration errors in HIDAPI by modifying `lib/SDL2/CMakeLists.txt:535-543`:

```cmake
# Skip -Werror flag on Apple to avoid HIDAPI compilation issues
if(HAVE_GCC_WERROR_DECLARATION_AFTER_STATEMENT AND NOT APPLE)
  list(APPEND EXTRA_CFLAGS "-Werror=declaration-after-statement")
endif()
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies are included as git submodules except:

- **mpv/ffmpeg** - Install via package manager (Homebrew on macOS, apt/dnf/pacman on Linux)
- **OpenGL** - System provided

### Included Submodules

- SDL2 (windowing, input, events)
- ImGui (UI framework)
- Lua 5.4 (scripting)
- glad2 (OpenGL loader)
- glm (math library)
- json (nlohmann/json)
- sol2 (Lua bindings)
- bitsery (serialization)
- tracy (profiling, optional)

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "OpenFunscripter.app is damaged"

This happens because the app is not signed. Right-click the app, select "Open", then click "Open" in the dialog.

Or remove the quarantine flag:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenFunscripter.app
```

### macOS: Missing video playback

Install mpv via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install mpv
```

### Linux: Missing libmpv.so

Install mpv development libraries:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libmpv-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install mpv-libs-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S mpv
```

### Windows: Missing mpv-2.dll

The Windows build includes mpv-2.dll in the bin folder. If missing, download from:
[https://mpv.io/installation/](https://mpv.io/installation/)
