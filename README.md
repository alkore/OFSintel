## Platform Support

- ✅ **macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)** - Fully tested and supported
- ⚠️ **Windows** - Should work, but untested in this fork
- ⚠️ **Linux** - Should work, but untested in this fork

For Windows and Linux, follow the build instructions below. They should work as the codebase is cross-platform, but please report any issues you encounter.

## Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ack00gar/OFS.git
cd OFS
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Build

#### macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel) - TESTED ✅

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use the automated build script!** It prevents common build issues like CMake policy errors and mpv architecture mismatches.

**Automated Build Script (Strongly Recommended)**

The build script automatically:
- Detects your Mac architecture (ARM64 or Intel)
- Checks for and installs ARM64 Homebrew (on Apple Silicon)
- Validates mpv architecture and reinstalls if needed
- Fixes CMake policy compatibility issues
- Handles all dependencies and configuration

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x build-macos.sh

# Standard Release build (optimized, smaller binary)
./build-macos.sh

# Debug build (includes development features)
BUILD_TYPE=Debug ./build-macos.sh

# Universal Binary (Intel + ARM64, requires both architecture dependencies)
UNIVERSAL_BINARY=yes ./build-macos.sh
```

The binary will be at: `bin/OpenFunscripter.app`

**Manual CMake Build (Advanced Users)**

> **Note:** Manual building may require additional flags for CMake policy compatibility and doesn't include automatic dependency validation. If you encounter errors, use the automated build script instead.

```bash
# Configure for ARM64 native build (Debug mode for full features)
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

# Build (use all CPU cores)
cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)

# The app bundle will be at: bin/OpenFunscripter.app
```

If you encounter CMake policy errors with submodules, add this flag:
```bash
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 \
  -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
```

For Universal Binary (Intel + ARM64):
```bash
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64" \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

**Before building manually, ensure you have the correct mpv architecture:**
```bash
# On Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5), use ARM64 Homebrew
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install mpv

# On Intel Macs, use standard Homebrew
/usr/local/bin/brew install mpv
```

#### Windows - UNTESTED ⚠️

```bash
# Configure
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build build --config Debug -j%NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%

# The executable will be at: bin\OpenFunscripter.exe
```

**Note:** Windows build is untested in this fork. The build should work as the original OFS supports Windows, but please report any issues.

#### Linux - UNTESTED ⚠️

```bash
# Configure
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# The executable will be at: bin/OpenFunscripter
```

**Note:** Linux build is untested in this fork. The build should work as the original OFS supports Linux, but please report any issues.

### 3. Install (Optional)

#### macOS

```bash
# Copy to Applications folder
cp -R bin/OpenFunscripter.app /Applications/
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Copy to /usr/local/bin
sudo cp bin/OpenFunscripter /usr/local/bin/
```

## Build Types

Choose the appropriate build type based on your needs:

- **Debug** (Recommended for development)
  - Includes debug symbols and development features
  - "Reset layout" option in View menu
  - Larger file size (~24MB on macOS)
  - No optimizations (slower performance)
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

- **Release** (Production)
  - Fully optimized for performance
  - Smallest file size (~5.5MB on macOS)
  - No debug features
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

- **RelWithDebInfo** (Balanced)
  - Optimized with debug symbols
  - Medium file size (~6MB on macOS)
  - Use: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

## SDL2 Compilation Fix (macOS ARM64)

This build includes a fix for SDL2 compilation on macOS ARM64. The fix prevents C99 declaration errors in HIDAPI by modifying `lib/SDL2/CMakeLists.txt:535-543`:

```cmake
# Skip -Werror flag on Apple to avoid HIDAPI compilation issues
if(HAVE_GCC_WERROR_DECLARATION_AFTER_STATEMENT AND NOT APPLE)
  list(APPEND EXTRA_CFLAGS "-Werror=declaration-after-statement")
endif()
```

## Dependencies

### macOS

**mpv is required for video playback.** Install via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install mpv
```

### Building from Source

All dependencies are included as git submodules except:

- **mpv/ffmpeg** - Required for video playback (Homebrew on macOS, apt/dnf/pacman on Linux)
- **OpenGL** - System provided

**Included Submodules:**
- SDL2 (windowing, input, events)
- ImGui (UI framework)
- Lua 5.4 (scripting)
- glad2 (OpenGL loader)
- glm (math library)
- json (nlohmann/json)
- sol2 (Lua bindings)
- bitsery (serialization)
- tracy (profiling, optional)

## macOS Installation & Code Signing

### ⚠️ Important: App is Not Code Signed

This app is **not code signed** with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS will show a security warning on first launch.

### How to Open the App

**Method 1: Right-Click Open (Recommended)**
1. Download and extract `OpenFunscripter.app`
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app
3. Select **"Open"** from the menu
4. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
5. The app will now run normally

**Method 2: Remove Quarantine Flag (Terminal)**
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenFunscripter.app
```

**Note:** You only need to do this **once**. After the first launch, the app will open normally.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: Architecture Mismatch (mpv loading fails)

**Symptom:** App runs but shows error: `Failed to load mpv library` or `incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64')`

**Cause:** You have Intel (x86_64) mpv installed on an Apple Silicon Mac, or vice versa.

**Solution:**

The `build-macos.sh` script automatically detects and fixes this issue. If you encounter this error:

```bash
# For Apple Silicon Macs - Install ARM64 mpv
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install mpv

# For Intel Macs - Install x86_64 mpv
/usr/local/bin/brew install mpv
```

Alternatively, rebuild as Universal Binary to support both architectures:
```bash
UNIVERSAL_BINARY=yes ./build-macos.sh
```

### macOS: Missing video playback

If video playback doesn't work, install mpv via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install mpv
```

### Linux: Missing libmpv.so

Install mpv development libraries:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libmpv-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install mpv-libs-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S mpv
```

### Windows: mpv-2.dll

The Windows build **automatically downloads the latest mpv build** during compilation from [zhongfly/mpv-winbuild](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild/releases) (updated daily).

**If automatic download fails:**
1. Download the latest `mpv-dev-x86_64-*.7z` (standard build, **NOT** the v3 variant) from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild/releases/latest)
2. Extract `mpv-2.dll` from the archive
3. Place it in your `build/` directory before compiling

**Note:** Use the standard `mpv-dev-x86_64-*.7z` build for maximum compatibility. The v3 variant (`mpv-dev-x86_64-v3-*.7z`) requires newer CPUs with AVX2 support and may not work on older systems.

The build system fetches the latest version automatically via GitHub API.
